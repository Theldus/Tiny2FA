.SH NAME
t2_get_key \- Gets the current key based in the base32 secret key passed by
parameter and the reference time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <tiny2fa.h>
.sp
.BI "int t2_get_key(const uint8_t " *b32_secret_key ", uint64_t " tm ");
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR t2_get_key ()
gets the current key (6 digits) based in the
.I secret_key
and the time (in seconds, unix time stamp)
.I tm
passed as parameter.
Note that if you want to use the current time, just pass 0 to
.I tm
and the function will use the current time instead of the parameter.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the current key based in the parameters.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <tiny2fa.h>

int main(void)
{
	int key;

	/* key in base32 with 32 digits. */
	const uint8_t b32_sk[T2_KEY_ENCODED_LENGTH + 1] =
		"A3WPD3B2SK5UNYCY7AI7ZMICC2LGDXQO";
	
	key = t2_get_key(sk, 0);
	printf("Generated key: %06d\\n", key);

	return (0);
